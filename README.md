# Hi
For more than a decade, I’ve worked across engineering, architecture, and product leadership — delivering cloud-native platforms, accelerating app delivery, and building secure APIs and developer ecosystems. My career has spanned enterprise environments, customer-facing products, and high-stakes modernization programs, often sitting at the intersection of software engineering, cybersecurity, and product strategy.

# I believe in:
Simple infrastructure over clever complexity
Security embedded, not bolted on
Strong automation, clean interfaces, and measurable ROI
Empowering teams with clarity, tools, and trust
Shipping value fast — with quality, rigor, and resilience
## Experience Highlights
Led engineering efforts building app accelerators, secure API platforms, and cloud modernization initiatives
Architected and launched developer portals, identity-first API ecosystems, and high-availability cloud services
Delivered multi-stack solutions across Terraform, Python, JavaScript/React, AWS, Kubernetes, and event-driven systems
Partnered with product, security, and exec teams to align technology outcomes with business value
Practiced secure-by-default principles aligned to NIST, OWASP, and regulated-industry standards
Mentored cross-functional teams, supported Agile delivery (Scrum/SAFe), and built cultures of ownership and curiosity
## Certifications & Skills
IASA CITA-F, Six Sigma Yellow Belt, ITIL
Expertise across modern cloud, app security practices, API management, DevOps pipelines, and data systems
Hands-on builder who still enjoys writing code, refining developer experience, and automating the mundane

# Philosophy
I design systems for the long run — resilient, observable, secure, and human-centered.
I measure success by developer adoption, speed to value, security posture, uptime, and customer delight.
Technology should empower people, not complicate their lives — and great engineering happens when clarity meets curiosity.
Outside the Keyboard
I’m a dad, tinkerer, and outdoors-and-tools guy who still values grit over noise and exploration over ego. Most days, you’ll find me balancing family life, early morning workouts, and a healthy obsession with building things — whether it’s cloud platforms, garden beds, or random mechanical projects with tiny helpers holding the screwdriver
